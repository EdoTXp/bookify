She was loved by all for her kindness, intelligence, and beauty.\n\nOne day, while Anya was walking through the forest near the castle, she was kidnapped by a fierce dragon named Vermithrax.\n\nThe king and queen were desperate to find their daughter. They sent their brave knights to search every corner of the kingdom, but no one was able to find her.\n\nYears passed and the hope of finding Anya began to fade. But the princess did not give up. She was held captive in a dark cave in Vermithrax's lair, but she never lost hope of being rescued.\n\nOne day, Anya heard a whisper in the cave. She followed the sound and found a tiny fairy named Lily. Lily was a forest fairy who had been captured by Vermithrax along with Anya.\n\nThe two quickly became friends and together they devised a plan to escape. Lily used her magic to open the cave door and Anya ran into the forest. She ran and ran until she finally reached the kingdom of Eldoria.\n\nAnya was welcomed with great joy by her people. The king and queen embraced her with tears of happiness. Anya told them about Lily and how she helped her escape. The king was so grateful that he had a house built for Lily in the castle garden.\n\nAnya and Lily lived happily ever after in the kingdom of Eldoria. And Vermithrax, the fierce dragon, was never seen again.",
